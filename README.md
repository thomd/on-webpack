Notes on using Webpack 4

## Basic Setup without configuration file

    npm init -y
    npm i -D webpack webpack-cli

The **default entry point** is `./src/index.js`

The **default output file** is `./dist/main.js`

Build in **Development mode** for optimized speed and an un-minified bundle:

    npx webpack --mode development

Build in **Production mode** to enable optimizations out of the box, including minification, scope hoisting, tree-shaking and more:

    npx webpack --mode production
